•   Chiggers are the larval (juvenile) form of a type of mite (Trombiculidae). Chiggers do not burrow into and remain inside the skin, contrary to popular belief. Chiggers inject digestive enzymes into the skin and feed upon the decomposed tissue.
•	Pronounced itching is the main symptom of chigger bites. Bites may appear as blisters or as flat or raised red areas. Treatment involves supportive measures to control itching.

Symptoms
1.	Pronounced itching is the most common symptom.
2.	The area of the bite may be reddened, flat, or raised; sometimes it resembles a pustule or blister.
3.	The itch is due to the presence of the stylostome and usually is most intense within 1-2 days after the bite.
4.	The itching persists for several days, and complete resolution of the skin lesions can take up to two weeks.
5.	If multiple bites are present, the condition may be mistaken for eczema or allergic contact dermatitis. A history of outdoor activity can suggest that chigger bites are the cause of itching and characteristic skin changes.

Treatment
Treatment for chigger bites is directed toward relieving the itching and inflammation. Calamine lotion and corticosteroid creams may be used to control itching. Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), may also be used for symptom relief.

If symptoms are severe, consult a doctor to get a well-tailored treatment plan.
