Eczema is a condition in which patches of skin become inflamed, itchy, cracked, and rough. Some types can also cause blisters. Many people use the word eczema when referring to atopic dermatitis, which is the most common type. The term atopic refers to a collection of conditions that involve the immune system, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and hay fever. The word dermatitis refers to inflammation of the skin. Some people outgrow the condition, while others will continue to have it throughout adulthood.

Symptoms
In most cases eczema symptoms are mild. The most common symptoms of atopic dermatitis include:
•	Dry, scaly skin
•	Skin flushing
•	Itching
•	Open, crusted, or weeping sores
People with severe eczema may need more intensive treatment to relieve their symptoms. Continuous rubbing and scratching can also lead to skin infections.

Treatment
There is no treatment for eczema. However, there are several things that people with eczema can do to support skin health and alleviate symptoms. They can try:
•	Taking lukewarm baths
•	Applying moisturizer within 3 minutes of bathing to “lock in” moisture
•	Moisturizing every day
•	Wearing cotton and soft fabrics
•	Avoiding rough, scratchy fibers and tight-fitting clothing
•	Using a humidifier in dry or cold weather
•	Using a mild soap or a non-soap cleanser when washing
•	Taking extra precautions to prevent eczema flares in winter
•	Air drying or gently patting the skin dry with a towel, rather than rubbing the skin dry after bathing or taking a shower
•	Where possible, avoiding rapid changes of temperature and activities that cause sweating
•	Learning and avoiding individual eczema triggers
•	Keeping fingernails short to prevent scratching from breaking the skin
•	People can also try various natural remedies for eczema, including aloe vera, coconut oil, and apple cider vinegar.

Medication
•	Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments: These are anti-inflammatory medications and should relieve the main symptoms of eczema, such as inflammation and itchiness. People can apply them directly to the skin. Some people may benefit from prescription-strength medications.
•	Oral medications: If topical treatments are not effective, a doctor may prescribe oral medications like systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppresants. These are available as injections or oral tablets. People should only use them for short periods of time. Also, it is important to note that the symptoms may worsen upon stopping these drugs if the person is not already taking another medication for the condition.
•	Antibiotics: Doctors prescribe antibiotics if eczema occurs alongside a bacterial skin infection.
•	Antihistamines: These can reduce the risk of nighttime scratching, as they tend to cause drowsiness.
•	Topical calcineurin inhibitors: This drug suppresses the activities of the immune system. It decreases inflammation and helps prevent flares.
•	Barrier repair moisturizers: These reduce water loss and work to repair the skin.
•	Phototherapy: This involves exposure to UVA or UVB waves. This method can treat moderate dermatitis. A doctor will monitor the skin closely throughout the treatment.
•	Injected biologic drugs: These medications block proteins in the immune system to limit immune system response.

If symptoms are severe, consult a doctor to get a well-tailored treatment plan.
