Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox is highly contagious to people who haven't had the disease or been vaccinated against it.
The itchy blister rash caused by chickenpox infection appears 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus and usually lasts about five to 10 days. Other signs and symptoms, which may appear one to two days before the rash, include:
•	Fever
•	Loss of appetite
•	Headache
•	Tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise)
Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases:
•	Raised pink or red bumps (papules), which break out over several days
•	Small fluid-filled blisters (vesicles), which form in about one day and then break and leak
•	Crusts and scabs, which cover the broken blisters and take several more days to heal
New bumps continue to appear for several days, so you may have all three stages of the rash — bumps, blisters and scabbed lesions — at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears, and the virus remains contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over.
Treatment
Use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for Pain and Fever
If you or your child has a high fever or achiness caused by chickenpox, reach for the Tylenol. It can even help relieve pain associated with sores that develop on your skin or in your mouth. It’s safe for most people, including pregnant women and children over 2 months old.
Avoid anti-inflammatory painkillers, like ibuprofen. If you have chickenpox, it can make you very ill. Never give aspirin to children under age 16. It can lead to a serious complication called Reye’s syndrome.
