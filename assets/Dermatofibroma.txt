Dermatofibromas are small, harmless growths that appear on the skin. These growths, or papules, can develop anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the arms, lower legs, and upper back. Dermatofibromas most commonly occur in adults and can affect people of any ethnicity. They are more prevalent among females than males and more common in people with a compromised immune system

Symptoms
Dermatofibromas tend to grow slowly. The growths typically have some defining characteristics that can aid their identification.
Key markers of a dermatofibroma are:
•	Appearance: A dermatofibroma presents as a round bump that is mostly under the skin.
•	Size: The normal range is about 0.5–1.5 centimeters (cm), with most lesions being 0.7–1.0 cm in diameter. The size will usually remain stable.
•	Color: The growths vary in color among individuals but will generally be pink, red, gray, brown, or black.
•	Location: Dermatofibromas are most common on the legs, but they sometimes appear on the arms, trunk, and, less commonly, elsewhere on the body.
•	Additional symptoms: Although they are usually harmless and painless, these growths may occasionally be itchy, tender, painful, or inflamed.
If a person pinches a dermatofibroma, it will not push toward the surface of the skin. Instead, it will dimple inward on itself. This characteristic can help people distinguish between a dermatofibroma and another type of growth.

Treatment
Most dermatofibromas do not require treatment. A person can safely leave them alone, and they will usually cause no symptoms aside from their appearance on the skin. A person should not try to remove these growths at home. Improper removal can lead to deep scarring, infection, and improper healing.

If symptoms are severe, consult a doctor to get a well-tailored treatment plan.
