Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused by a tiny burrowing mite called Sarcoptes scabiei. Intense itching occurs in the area where the mite burrows. The urge to scratch may be especially strong at night.
Scabies is contagious and can spread quickly through close physical contact in a family, child- care group, school class, nursing home or prison. Because scabies is so contagious, doctors often recommend treatment for entire families or contact groups.
Scabies can be readily treated. Medications applied to your skin kill the mites that cause scabies and their eggs. But you may still have some itching for several weeks after treatment.
Symptoms
Scabies signs and symptoms include:
•	Itching, often severe and usually worse at night
•	Thin, irregular burrow tracks made up of tiny blisters or bumps on your skin
The burrows or tracks typically appear in folds of skin. Though almost any part of the body may be involved, in adults and older children scabies is most often found:
•	Between the fingers
•	In the armpits
•	Around the waist
•	Along the insides of the wrists
•	On the inner elbows
•	On the soles of the feet
•	Around the breasts
•	Around the male genital area
•	On the buttocks
•	On the knees
In infants and young children, common sites of infestation usually include the:
•	Scalp
•	Palms of the hands
•	Soles of the feet
If you've had scabies before, signs and symptoms may develop within a few days of exposure. If you've never had scabies, it can take as long as six weeks for signs and symptoms to begin. You can still spread scabies even if you don't have any signs or symptoms yet.
Treatment
Medications commonly prescribed for scabies include:
•	Permethrin cream. Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children age 2 months and older.
•	Ivermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who weigh less than 33 pounds (15 kilograms).
•	Crotamiton (Eurax, Crotan). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. The safety of this medication hasn't been established in children, adults 65 and older, or women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.
