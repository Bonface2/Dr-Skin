Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp.
Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while or going into remission. Treatments are available to help you manage symptoms. And you can incorporate lifestyle habits and coping strategies to help you live better with psoriasis.
Symptoms
Psoriasis signs and symptoms can vary from person to person. Common signs and symptoms include:
•	Red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales
•	Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children)
•	Dry, cracked skin that may bleed or itch
•	Itching, burning or soreness
•	Thickened, pitted or ridged nails
•	Swollen and stiff joints
Psoriasis patches can range from a few spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions that cover large areas. The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms.
Treatment
•	Steroids. If you have a few small, persistent psoriasis patches, your doctor might suggest an injection of triamcinolone right into the lesions.
•	Retinoids. Acitretin (Soriatane) and other retinoids are pills used to reduce the production of skin cells. Side effects might include dry skin and muscle soreness. These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant or breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.
•	Methotrexate. Usually administered weekly as a single oral dose, methotrexate (Trexall) decreases the production of skin cells and suppresses inflammation. It's less effective than adalimumab (Humira) and infliximab (Remicade). It might cause upset stomach, loss of appetite and fatigue. People taking methotrexate long term need ongoing testing to monitor their blood counts and liver function.
Men and women should stop taking methotrexate at least three months before attempting to conceive. This drug is not recommended when you're breast-feeding.
•	Cyclosporine. Taken orally for severe psoriasis, cyclosporine (Neoral) suppresses the immune system. It's similar to methotrexate in effectiveness but cannot be used continuously for more than a year. Like other immunosuppressant drugs, cyclosporine increases your risk of infection and other health problems, including cancer. People taking cyclosporine need ongoing monitoring of their blood pressure and kidney function.
These drugs are not recommended when you're pregnant, breast-feeding or if you intend to become pregnant.
•	Biologics. These drugs, usually administered by injection, alter the immune system in a way that disrupts the disease cycle and improves symptoms and signs of disease within weeks. Several of these drugs are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in people who haven't responded to first-line therapies. The therapeutic options are rapidly expanding. Examples include etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ixekizumab (Taltz). These types of drugs are expensive and may or may not be covered by health insurance plans.
Biologics must be used with caution because they carry the risk of suppressing your immune system in ways that increase your risk of serious infections. In particular, people taking these treatments must be screened for tuberculosis.
•	Other medications. Thioguanine (Tabloid) and hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea) are medications that can be used when other drugs can't be given. Apremilast (Otezla) is taken by mouth twice a day. It's especially effective at reducing itching. Talk with your doctor about possible side effects of these drugs.
