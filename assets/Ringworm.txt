Ringworm, also known as dermatophytosis, dermatophyte infection, or tinea, is a fungal infection of the skin. The infection initially appears as red patches on affected areas of the skin and later may spread to other parts of the body. It may affect the scalp, feet, nails, groin, beard or other areas.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary depending on where you’re infected. With a skin infection, you may experience the following:
•	red, itchy, or scaly patches, or raised areas of skin called plaques
•	patches that develop blisters or pustules
•	patches that may be redder on the outside edges or resemble a ring
•	patches with edges that are defined and raised

Treatment
Your doctor may prescribe various medications depending on the severity of your ringworm infection. Jock itch, athlete’s foot, and ringworm of the body can all be treated with topical medications, such as antifungal creams, ointments, gels, or sprays.
Ringworm of the scalp or nails may require prescription-strength oral medications such as griseofulvin (Gris-PEG) or terbinafine.
Over-the-counter (OTC) medications and antifungal skin creams may be recommended for use as well. These products may contain clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine, or other related ingredients.
