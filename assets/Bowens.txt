Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer that's easily treatable. The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin. It affects the squamous cells, which are in the outermost layer of skin, and is sometimes referred to as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The patch is usually very slow growing, but there's a small chance it could turn into a more serious type of skin cancer if left untreated.
The most effective method of reducing your risk of Bowen's disease, as well as other more serious types of skin cancer, is to limit your exposure to the sun.
Symptoms
Bowen's disease usually appears as a patch on the skin that has clear edges and does not heal.
The patch may be:
•	Red or pink
•	Scaly or crusty
•	Flat or raised
•	Up to a few centimetres across
•	Itchy (but not all the time)

If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer) or develops a lump, it could be a sign it's turned into squamous cell skin cancer.
Treatment
•	Cryotherapy – liquid nitrogen is sprayed on to the affected skin to freeze it. The procedure may be painful and the skin may remain a bit uncomfortable for a few days. The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks.
•	Imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) – this is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better.
•	Curettage and cautery – the affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic, where the skin is numbed, and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks.
•	Photodynamic therapy (PDT) – a light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin and a laser is directed on to the skin a few hours later to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session lasts about 20 to 45 minutes. You may need more than 1 session.
•	Surgery – the abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards.
